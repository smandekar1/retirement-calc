<h2>Overspending &ndash; Coming Clean on Your Spending </h2>

<p>Robert Plant once said, &ldquo;People say that I'm a millionaire, but that's not true - I only spend millions.&rdquo; His point illustrates that many of us spend a lot and often much more than we should in proportion to our income. The issue of money and overspending is one of the leading reasons why people end up getting divorced. We should not be surprised by the problems that spending our money can cause because money represents so much to each one of us. For instance, it can mean a representation of our reward for our work. It can mean the method by which we are able to eat and pay for shelter. It can be the tool that allows us to have fun. Whatever money is used for, it should be recognized as a tool that needs to be used responsibly. Overspending is caused by someone. Maybe it&rsquo;s yourself, maybe it&rsquo;s your spouse, but it&rsquo;s caused by someone. It doesn&rsquo;t just happen by itself, someone takes actions to cause money to be spent and these actions need to be looked at closely. Included here are some ways to stop overspending.<br></p>  
  <p><strong>1. Look at every transaction that you&rsquo;ve made for the month.</strong> For each transaction, consider if what you bought was necessary and if it was worth it. For larger items that you are going to purchase, consider having a waiting period before you go ahead and purchase the item. This can help take your emotions out of the buying decision which can help you think more clearly about the buying decision. And yes, people make poor buying decisions based on their emotions.<br><br>  
  <strong>2. Ask a friend for input on your spending decisions.</strong> There&rsquo;s nothing like getting advice from a person that you trust has your best interest at heart. When it comes to your budget, their input can be invaluable. Ask them, &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m spending too much on this?&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;do you think it&rsquo;s ok if I buy xyz?&rdquo; Where there is no guidance the people fall, but in abundance of counselors there is victory. (Prov. 11:4)<br><br>  
  <strong>3. Find consensus among your family members.</strong> If your spouse is causing the problem, find a tool that can keep both of you on track. Often two people that are very different in the area of finances get together and that&rsquo;s why you liked each other. That was the fun part. Now&rsquo;s the hard part, you have to live with someone who&rsquo;s spending habits are different from yours. One tool that can help couples watch their finances is a spreadsheet, which we use in our home. Put the items that you are going to buy on a spreadsheet and have the both of you initial the purchases before they are made. This way, you know that both of you have agreed to buy an item or a certain group of items (ex: groceries, $175.00) before the purchase is made. This would follow a similar process found at businesses where a purchase order is issued for items at a set price to be received in the future. The goal here is not that you turn your family into a business but the each of you are more at peace with your spending decisions. Another challenge will be hammering out how much should be spent on what between the both of you. Enjoy!<br><br>  
  <strong>4. Find an appropriate way to budget.</strong> You can budget by category and many people do this successfully. I do not like this method for a couple of reasons. Sometimes people put out a number that is higher than what is needed. For example, if I say we as a family should spend $2000 per year on entertainment, then as the year goes on we are looking for ways to &ldquo;use&rdquo; that money up. Whereas you could just see what you need on a case by case basis for entertainment and purchase what you need. For example, if the family wants to take a trip to the amusement park, we can think about it for a week or two. The amusement park is not going anywhere. Then once we decide to go, we buy our tickets and don&rsquo;t go crazy on items and food at the park, maybe we eat before we get there or bring some food with us. Now, to some people, this seems like a horrible way to have to live, but if you have an overspending problem, then drastic measures are certainly necessary.<br><br> 
  <strong>5. If you have a spending problem, make a game out of being thrifty.</strong> Take the amount that you usually spend per month and see how low you can go with it. Can you cut it by 10, 20 or 50 percent? I once saw an exercise where a family had only about $1000 they could spend for the month and this was much less than they were used to spending. The family met the goal going under the $1000 in spending but what they really came to understand was that they were spending money on so much stuff that they really didn&rsquo;t need. In the following months, they didn&rsquo;t keep their spending level that low but they recognized that they wanted to buy things that they really needed.<br><br>  
  <strong>6. Understand that you will not be able to retire if you overspend.</strong> This is a sad truth in this process and it may be the motivation that you need to change your habits. If you consistently have more going out that coming in, then at this point you are already probably trying to tread water with you debts. It&rsquo;s a horrible place to be, trying to figure out which credit card pay off or which one has the lowest interest rate. The headache and stress of facing uncontrollable debt should be enough motivation for getting your spending under control. Best wishes to you, I hope this helps and keep at it. Year after year of practice on watching your spending will help you control it and bring many benefits.<br><br> </p>
